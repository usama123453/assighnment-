Your Task : You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function activityselection() which takes array start[ ], array end[ ] and integer N as input parameters and returns the maximum number of activities that can be done.
Expected Time Complexity : O(N * Log(N)) Expected Auxilliary Space : O(N)
Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 2*105 1 ≤ start[i] ≤ end[i] ≤ 109
# no_of_activities --> Total number of activities
# start[]-->initialize array to store start time of all activities
# end[] --> initialize array to store end time of all activities
  
# create function having two parameters for find maximum activates 
def activityselection(start , end ):
    n = len(end)
    print "The following activities are selected"
  
    # select the first activity 
    i = 0
    print i
  
    #iterate the rest of activity 
     for j in range(n):
       # If this activity has start time greater tha or equal to the finish time of previously selected activity, then select it
        if s[j] >= f[i]:
            print j,
            i = j 
# store the deep copy results in these array 
start= []
end = []
print  activityselection(start , end)
